Fake AI Recommender System
📌 Project Overview

Fake AI Recommender System is a mini project developed in C that simulates the working logic of an AI-based recommendation system. The project does not use real machine learning algorithms; instead, it demonstrates how recommendation behavior can be mimicked using predefined rules, conditions, and user inputs.

The goal of this project is to help students understand the basic logic behind recommender systems and how decision-making systems can be implemented using fundamental programming concepts.
